# About the project

The analysis of the labour market in France with a particular focus on the gender pay gap. It was carried out 
based on average hourly net wages in the commune, with breakdowns by gender, age and position collected 
by the French statistical office (INSEE) and available at: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/etiennelq/french-employment-by-town?select=population.csv. 

The data was collected prior to 2016 based on the administrative division of France, which is no longer in force.

## Data analysis and visualization

Exploratory data analysis was performed by using language SQL (PostgreSQL). The preprocessed datasets were exported as csv files and used to create Tableau visualizations which can be downloaded directly from this repository or preview here:
